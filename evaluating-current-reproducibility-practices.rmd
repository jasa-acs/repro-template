# Things DTL & Gentleman wanted that we don't entirely have

1. Proper Compendiums

    - Require imposing structure on computational materials
    - Why are journals accomodating with comp materials but not with paper 
      formatting?
    - What benefits do we get with this?

2. Virtual machines included with compendiums

    - "It works on my machine" goes back to > 40 years (mac/windows/unix).

# Alternatives - how should our conception of compendiums change?

1. Actions

# A manuscipt is a static document, is the problem that a compendium is not?

1. If so, how to we incentivize it's use?

    - Include download statistics as we do citations?
