This directory would generally contain results of the simulations or real data analyses, potentially including figure files, files containing numerical values for manuscript tables. Also, intermediate output files might be placed here, cached to avoid having to rerun computationally-intensive steps of the workflow. 

Figure files and files containing tabular information might also be placed in the `manuscript` directory.
